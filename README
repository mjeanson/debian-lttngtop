Lttngtop is an ncurses interface for reading and browsing traces recorded by
the LTTng tracer and displaying various statistics.
As of now, the cpu usage, per file/process I/O bandwidth and perf counters are
displayed. This version currently only supports offline traces, but a live
version is in alpha and will be available for testing soon.

USAGE
-----

The manpage located in the doc folder of this source tree documents the usage
of LTTngTop.

BUILDING
--------

	./bootstrap (skip if using tarball)
	./configure
	make
	make install

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To compile Babeltrace and lttngtop, you will need:

	gcc 3.2 or better
	libc6 development librairies
	  (Debian : libc6, libc6-dev)
	  (Fedora : glibc, glibc)
	glib 2.22 or better development libraries
	  (Debian : libglib2.0-0, libglib2.0-dev)
	  (Fedora : glib2, glib2-devel)
	libpopt >= 1.13 development libraries
	  (Debian : libpopt-dev)
	  (Fedora : popt)
	ncurses development libraries
	  (Debian : libncurses5-dev)
	babeltrace development library

For developers using the git tree:

This source tree is based on the autotools suite from GNU to simplify
portability. Here are some things you should have on your system in order to
compile the git repository tree :

- GNU autotools (automake >=1.10, autoconf >=2.50, autoheader >=2.50)
  (make sure your system wide "automake" points to a recent version!)
- GNU Libtool >=2.2
  (for more information, go to http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

If you get the tree from the repository, you will need to use the "bootstrap"
script in the root of the tree. It calls all the GNU tools needed to prepare the
tree configuration.
